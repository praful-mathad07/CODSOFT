                    <p>Gardeners often disregard the impact soil has on the health and vigor of their plants. Soil

                        preparation

                        isn't the most thrilling aspect of planting a garden, but it's certainly one of the most

                        important.</p>

                    <p>

                        “A garden is a reflection of the quality of its soil. Gardens filled with beautiful soil have a

                        vitality

                        about them that we can almost feel,” says landscape designer and author Jan Johnsen.</p>

                    <p>

                        Achieving that vitality requires understanding the chemistry and composition of your soil and

                        creating

                        the perfect environment for fertile plant growth. Good soil management is a continual process,

                        but once

                        you attend to the basics, your soil will do most of the work itself.</p>

                            <p>Anyone who has gardened knows that plants need nourishment in order to be healthy and

                                thrive. In residential landscapes, Mother Nature needs a little help from gardeners to

                                replace depleted nutrients. Since plants have different needs and there are many

                                different types of fertilizers, knowing when and how to fertilize can be daunting.

                                Here's some basic information to help you better understand what type of fertilizer(s)

                                your garden needs.</p>

 

                            <h4 class="pt-3">Types of Fertilizer:</h4>

                            <p>

                                <span class="hd fw-bold">Organic vs. inorganic:</span>

                                Fertilizers are available as organic (plant or animal derived) or inorganic (man-made

                                from chemicals). Organic types are better for the environment and help to improve

                                overall soil health. Inorganic fertilizers do nothing to improve soil and have no

                                positive residual effect. In some cases, they can be harmful to the environment and

                                wildlife, so it's important to weigh the pros and cons before using.</p>

                            <p>

                                <span class="hd fw-bold">Granular vs. water-soluble:</span>

                                There are two basic forms of fertilizers, each with advantages and drawbacks. Slow

                                release granular fertilizers have the advantage of delivering nutrients over a longer

                                period of time. Water-soluble fertilizers are faster acting, delivering a boost of

                                nutrients when plants need a quick pick-me-up. These are generally less harsh and not as

                                long-lasting, so need to be applied more frequently.</p>
